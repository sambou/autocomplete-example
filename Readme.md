# Haskell Autocomplete Example
This is a small example for a simple autocomplete service using Haskell, bytestring tries, scotty and RxJS.

# Ideas for improvement
- Add setup instructions
- Add lookup values in lowercase only to trie to allow searching without worrying about casing
- Style HTML
- Add some tests
